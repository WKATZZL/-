# 简单矩阵类的实现 Simple Matrix
Implement a matrix class with real numbers (data type: double) as elements. The following basic operations should be implemented:

- Construct a matrix with a given two-dimensional double array that represents the initialized elements
- Construct a matrix with specified amounts of rows and columns, setting all elements as zero by default
- Set the value of the element located at the specified row and column
- Get the value of the element located at the specified row and column
- Matrix addition
- Matrix multiplication

Customized exception classes should be designed and thrown for the above operations where applicable (e.g., shapes of matrices mismatch for calculation, requested element out of bound).
Write test cases in the main method to cover all the above functionalities.

设计实现矩阵类，至少支持非空实数矩阵（浮点数）的新建，任意位置赋值以及矩阵之间的累加和乘积。
当出现非法操作如矩阵形状不匹配时，应抛出自定义异常。
在main方法中完成覆盖上述功能点的测试用例。
